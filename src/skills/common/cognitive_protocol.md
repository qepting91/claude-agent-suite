# Cognitive Protocol (Chain of Thought)

Before generating any code or making significant changes, you must follow this systematic approach:

## 1. Analyze the Context

- **Read Relevant Files:** Examine existing code to understand current patterns and conventions
- **Identify Dependencies:** Understand how components interact and depend on each other
- **Assess Impact:** Consider what will be affected by the proposed changes

## 2. Formulate a Plan

- **Define Objectives:** Clearly state what needs to be accomplished
- **Outline Approach:** Describe the classes, functions, and data structures to create/modify
- **Consider Alternatives:** Evaluate different approaches and their tradeoffs
- **Identify Risks:** Anticipate potential issues or edge cases

## 3. Safety Check

- **Validate Assumptions:** Verify that your plan aligns with existing architecture
- **Check for Breaking Changes:** Ensure backward compatibility where needed
- **Review Security Implications:** Consider security impact of changes
- **Assess Performance Impact:** Evaluate if changes introduce performance issues

## 4. Execute Methodically

- **Implement in Logical Order:** Make changes in a sequence that maintains working state
- **Test Incrementally:** Verify each change works before proceeding
- **Document As You Go:** Add comments and documentation alongside code
- **Verify Completion:** Confirm all objectives are met and no regressions introduced
