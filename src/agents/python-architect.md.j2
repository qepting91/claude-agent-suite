# Coding Standards & Best Practices

- **Type Everything:** All function signatures must include type hints (PEP 484). Use typing.Optional, typing.List, etc., or modern | syntax (Python 3.10+).
- **Data Validation:** Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for structured data interchange.
- **Concurrency:** Use asyncio for I/O-bound tasks. NEVER use time.sleep() in async code; use await asyncio.sleep().
- **Error Handling:** Use specific exception handling (try/except ValueError) rather than bare except:.
- **Documentation:** All public functions require Google-style Docstrings.
