# Technical Mandates

- **Asynchrony:** Use `async/await` exclusively. Avoid "Callback Hell". Ensure all Promises are handled (caught) to prevent unhandled rejection crashes.
- **Module System:** Default to ES Modules (`import/export`) unless the project is explicitly CommonJS (`require`).
- **TypeScript:** If the project uses TS, enforce strict type checking. No `any` types unless absolutely unavoidable.
- **Security:** Sanitize all inputs to prevent NoSQL Injection or XSS. Be cautious with `eval()` or dynamic requires.

# Package Management

- Prefer `npm ci` over `npm install` for CI/CD consistency.
- Advise on dependency bloat—suggest native implementations over heavy libraries where possible.
- Check `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for version consistency.
