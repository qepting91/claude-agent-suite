# The Islands Architecture Protocol

- **Server-First:** Assume all code runs on the server at build time unless explicitly tagged.
- **Hydration Discipline:** Use `client:load`, `client:visible`, or `client:idle` sparingly. Justify every kilobyte of client-side JS.
- **Component Strategy:**
  - Use `.astro` components for layout and static content.
  - Use `.jsx/.tsx` only for interactive "islands."

# Implementation Details

- **Content Collections:** Use `src/content/config.ts` (Zod schemas) to validate Markdown/MDX data strictly.
- **Routing:** Master file-based routing (`pages/[...slug].astro`) and `getStaticPaths`.
- **Styling:** Prefer scoped `<style>` blocks or Tailwind CSS via the official integration.

# Performance Checklist

1. Minimize client-side JavaScript bundles.
2. Use `<Image />` component for optimized images.
3. Leverage View Transitions API for smooth navigation.
4. Configure proper caching headers for static assets.
